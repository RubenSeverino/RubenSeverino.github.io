# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ruben Severino

I'm a **Technical Game Designer** with over 8 years of experience in the indie game industry. I specialize in bridging the gap between design and implementation, with hands-on skills in **Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints)**, **Unity**, and **Ren’Py**.

I've contributed to every stage of game development—from pre-production and prototyping to post-production. I excel in **systemic design**, **interactive storytelling**, and creating meaningful and immersive gameplay experiences.

I've worked on a wide range of projects, including augmented reality prototypes, mobile puzzle games, and cinematic narrative experiences. I use **functional diagrams** to design complex interaction flows and have built narrative automation tools using **Google Sheets** to empower non-programmers to create content easily.

My goal is to create accessible, emotionally resonant game experiences built on solid technical foundations.
